Ever want a url like http://mydomain.com/+ that links to your Google+ profile but never knew how? Well this is what this repo will do.

You'll need to create a directory on your webroot named '+' in which to place the index.php file in.

$ mkdir 0644 /var/www/+

You'll need to edit the $gUrl variable to your own Google+ profile url.
